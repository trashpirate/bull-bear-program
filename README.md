### How to Play the BullBear Game

1. **Round Initialization:**
   - The game creator sets up the parameters:
     - **Cryptocurrency**: The token for price prediction (e.g., SOL).
     - **Bet Token**: The SPL token used for placing bets and paying rewards.
     - **Round Interval**: The duration of the round.
   - When the round starts, the current price of the selected cryptocurrency is recorded as `start_price`, and the `start_time` is noted.

2. **Betting Phase:**
   - The betting phase is **open** at the start of the round.
   - Players place bets predicting the price movement of the selected cryptocurrency at `end_time` (`start_time + round_interval`):
     - **Bull**: Predicting the price will go **up**.
     - **Bear**: Predicting the price will go **down**.
   - Bets can only be placed during the first half of the interval.

3. **Betting Closes:**
   - Once half of the round interval has passed, the betting phase is **closed**. No more bets are accepted for the ongoing round.

4. **Outcome Determination:**
   - At `end_time`, the price of the cryptocurrency is observed as `end_price`.
   - The price movement is evaluated:
     - If `end_price` > `start_price`: **Up**.
     - If `end_price` < `start_price`: **Down**.
     - If `end_price` == `start_price`: **No change**.

5. **Winners and Protocol Rules:**
   - Players who predicted the price movement correctly are the **winners**.
   - If there is no price change, the protocol wins, and all funds are transferred to the game vault.

6. **Claiming Rewards:**
   - After the round ends, winners can claim their rewards from the prize pool.
   - Each winner's reward is proportional to their bet amount compared to the total bet amount on the winning side.

## Features and Customization
- **Custom Cryptocurrencies**: Choose any token with a price feed on the Pyth Oracle network.
- **Flexible Betting Tokens**: Use any SPL token for betting and rewards.
- **Dynamic Intervals**: Define custom time intervals for each game round.



The BullBear Game combines blockchain transparency with the thrill of market prediction, creating a fair and engaging experience for all players. Predict, bet, and claim your winningsâ€”are you ready to take on the market?
